Superpixels

CHOLMOD for sparse cholesky updating

What we want is a "minimum but sufficient" color basis for the image
a color basis is a set of colors along with an approximate region of support in the image
i.e. this reddish-color holds sway over this set of pixels

Such a basis is subjective. But the two terms are:
minimum -- as few colors as possible that span as few pixels as possible
sufficient -- it should be possible to represent any desired change to the colors in the image by modifying the basis (no need to subdivide down to the level of pixels)

Possible ways to form such a basis:
-- downsample the image ("square superpixels")
-- standard superpixels
-- superpixels with multiple colors
-- pyramid approach?

In theory, we could then merge invidiual channels of the superpixels with multiple colors approach to form layers
Perhaps only merge a superpixel channel if their corresponding superpixels have a sufficiently good mapping?

instead of using ANN, just search over a fixed radius for the k-closest colors?

Algorithm 1
-- do superpixelpalette segmenetation for 6 colors per pixel
-- place an edge between k-nearest colors (or all adjacent?) if:
   * the superpixels are sufficiently similar
   * the colors are close enough
   * model this as a simple soft-product sort of behavior?
-- layers are all connected components in this graph

two vertices belong to the same region if:
 -- there exists at least one edge connecting them with weight=0.1
 -- there exists a k-flow path connecting them

 interface
  -- select a color
  -- click on a region and drag a growing-radius object. The bigger the radius, the more influence things will be constrained
